This project was designed to obtain a Framework / IDE for wxPython to get a better
result of the Framework currently in circulation. The idea is to have all controllers
wx defined dynamically so you can add new custom controllers.

Exporting graphics in a kind of XRC - XUL, custom, the framework should help write
a MVC in wxPython.

Are welcome to any type of aid-help.
